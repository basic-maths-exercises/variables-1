# Getting started
You are going to learn how to program using python as part of the SOR1020 course by performing a series of exercises using this system, which is called repl.  Even though you are studying maths learning how to program is useful as:

- Programming is a key skill that many employers want their employees to have.
- To write a program that exploits a mathematical model or idea you really have to understand that model/idea.
- Once you get the hang of programming you will have a set of tools that you can use to explore/test the mathematical ideas that you are being taught in more detail. 

If previous students are any guide, however, you are going to find getting started with writing programs hard.  In this exercise, I am thus going to show you how you can ask for help.

The window on the top left contains some python code.  What this Python code does is not particularly important for now.  All we are going to do here is run the code, which we can do by pressing the run button.  Press this button now.

Now that the code has run you should see the following lines in the black (terminal) window that appears on the bottom left:

````
The value of x is 19
The value of y is 10
````

The idea with these exercises is that I give you some instructions on how to write some code to do something here.  You write your code and then test whether or not it does what I ask for.  You can then test whether or not your code does what I asked you to do.  To test the code in the window on the left click the down arrow on the run button and you should see an option to run tests.  Run the tests now.

When you run the tests for the code on the left a window will open that will tell you that you have failed.  This is deliberate on my part - on all the other exercises you should be able to pass if you follow my instructions.  On this test, however, there is nothing you can do to pass the test as I want to simulate what might happen to you if you get stuck on one of these exercises.

With that in mind, let's proceed as if this were a real problem that you were stuck on.  Press submit now.  When you do so the code will run and the tests will also run.  You will thus find, once again, that the code fails.  This time, however, you will be presented with some options.  Select submit anyway from these options.  When you select this option repl lets me know that you are struggling and also lets me see what you have tried.  I can thus get in touch with help as you should see in due course.
